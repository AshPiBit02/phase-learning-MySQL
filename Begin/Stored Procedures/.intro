# Stored Procedures
- a precomplied set of SQL statements stored in the database.
- allows to perform specific operations, including complex business logic, in a single call.
- Syntax: DELIMETER $$ CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name(paramterers) BEGIN
          sql_satements
          END $$
          DELIMETER;



In MySQL, a delimiter is a character(or set of characters) that tells MySQL where one SQL statement ends.
When one write stored procedures, functions, triggers, or events, the SQL code inside them already uses(;).
So, MySQL gets confused and thinks the statement ends to early. To avoid this, we change the delimiter temporarily.
Commonly used delimeters are $$,//,##.
