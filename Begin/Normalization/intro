# Normalizaton 
- process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- a design principle that ensures each piece of data is stored in the most logical place.
- goal is to make database efficient, consistent, and easier to maintain.
# Use
- eliminate redundancy
- ensures data integrity
- improves query efficiency
- simplifies maintenance and reduces chances of inconsistent data.
# Type:
1. 1NF
- atomic, no repeating groups
- prevents multi-valued columns.
2. 2NF
- must be in 1NF first
- no partial dependency on part of a composite key.
- removes redundancy in table with compositive keys.
3. 3NF 
- must be in 2NF first
- no transitive dependency(non-key attributes depend only on the key)
- ensures non-key attributes depend directly on the primary key.
4. BCNF(Boyce-Codd NF)
- must be in 3NF
- every determinant must be a candidate key.
- stronger version of 3NF, eliminates anomalies.
5. 4NF
- must be in BCNF first
- no multi-valued dependencies.
- Handles complex relationships with multiple independent attributes.
6. 5NF 
- must be in 4NF
- no join dependency.
- ensures tables can be reconstructed without redundency.
